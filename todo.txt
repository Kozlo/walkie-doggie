- Instead of a separate profile page, have the home page show different content depending on whether the user is logged in or not
  - probably also add link to infographics in navbar (logged in)
  - probably also add prices to the home page (not logged in)
  - further - maybe have some other page with user-specific data (email, password, phone etc.) and other info (booked walks, previous walks with info/comments)

(SUSPENDED)- create a profile page accessible via a link directly (e.g. host/user/someUserName
  NOTE: this will be discussed later and maybe left in a different format....
  (DONE)- need to figure out how to extract user data from Auth0: the data is stored in localstorage as 'user'
  (DONE)- need to add a link in the header to "profile"
    (DONE)- need to add a route to router configuration
  (DONE)- need to add an empty 'profile' page
  - need to adjust Layout to be different for the profile page
    - MAYBE move the navbars to each specific page, and then pass a property telling which page it is
      - maybe even pass navbar items with a property
  - need to adjust navbar to be different for the profile page
  - need to make the "profile" component similar ar the "home" component so that something is shown
[BUG] when going to the profile page and back, the navbar and the header aren't visible

Later:
- Replace Bootstrap with react-bootstrap
- Figure out how to have login and register buttons separately (with the default Auth0 modal it's the same button)
- create separate login/register pages
