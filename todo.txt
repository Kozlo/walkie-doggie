TO DO:
- Instead of a separate profile page, have the home page show different content depending on whether the user is logged in or not
  (SUSPENDED)- create a section for infographics
  (SUSPENDED)- create a section for 'info about us'
  (SUSPENDED)- create a section for pricing?
  (DONE)- Rename "services" section with "Dog Walking" section indicating it's about that
  (DONE)- replace existing pics with random ppl with Ilzite and Martintins
  (DONE)- replace the twitter section with a 'contacts' section
  (DONE)- change the footer accordingly
  (DONE)- create a different-looking home page when the user is logged in (also figure out the best way to show the content)

Improvements:
  - probably add a button for 'intro' for the home page
  - probably also add link to infographics in navbar (logged in)
  - probably also add prices to the home page (not logged in)
  - further - maybe have some other page with user-specific data (email, password, phone etc.) and other info (booked walks, previous walks with info/comments)

(SUSPENDED)- create a profile page accessible via a link directly (e.g. host/user/someUserName
  NOTE: this will be discussed later and maybe left in a different format....
  (DONE)- need to figure out how to extract user data from Auth0: the data is stored in localstorage as 'user'
  (DONE)- need to add a link in the header to "profile"
    (DONE)- need to add a route to router configuration
  (DONE)- need to add an empty 'profile' page
  - need to adjust Layout to be different for the profile page
    - MAYBE move the navbars to each specific page, and then pass a property telling which page it is
      - maybe even pass navbar items with a property
  - need to adjust navbar to be different for the profile page
  - need to make the "profile" component similar ar the "home" component so that something is shown
[BUG] when going to the profile page and back, the navbar and the header aren't visible

Functional
- Registration button on homepage
  - What happens when clicking on the register button in the homepage?
  - What style should the registration button on homepage be?
  - What text should the registration button have
- Infographics
  - Should we keep the existing style? Like it's for the top section?
    - should we keep the 'services'?
  -

- About us
  - what should be included in this section?
  - should we keep 'the team'?
  - should we add different services like "walking", "running", "dog sitting"?

- Contacts
  - how should it look like?

- Footer
  - what should be included?

Later:
- Replace Bootstrap with react-bootstrap
- maybe update the CSS/JS files to remove stuff that isn't needed anymore
- Figure out how to have login and register buttons separately (with the default Auth0 modal it's the same button)
- create separate login/register pages

Business matters:
- consider hiring people instead of paying per walk (do some research for this)
- consider going to a business incubator
