(DONE)- clean the Walkie Doggie Database to get rid of all crappy usernames
(DONE)- test if creating a user with other fields works as well
(DONE)- clean up account create code (prolly for now do nothing when the user is created)
- find out the best way to log the user in once the account is registered (probably do this after the user page is created)
- create a login page
- create a login popup
- create a profile page accessible via a link directly (e.g. host/user/someUserName
- create a register page (besides popup) that can be accessed directly by a URL, not only by a popup
