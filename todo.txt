- Create login/register page for now and then figure out about the popups and login/registration separation, additional data etc.
  - OR maybe just add popup for now instead and add the page later as it's easier....
- Figure out how to have login and register buttons separately (wiht the default Auth0 modal it's the same button)
- create a profile page accessible via a link directly (e.g. host/user/someUserName
  - need to figure out how to extract user data from Auth0
-[BUG]: fix 'close' buttons for the modals if still relevant after Auth0

Later:
- Replace Bootstrap with react-bootstrap
